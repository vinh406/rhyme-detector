# Automated Rhyme Detector
The Automated Rhyme Detector is a program that takes in a text file and outputs an HTML file with the rhymes highlighted in the style of Genius Check The Rhyme videos.

To use the program, simply edit the `input.txt` file with the text you want to analyze and run the `main.py` file. The program will output an `output.html` file with the rhymes highlighted.
